title: Ways that I trick the monkey inside my brain into getting things done
---
Whenever I set myself a task, I set three measures for its completion. The first is completing the task in full. For example, if my goal is to make notes on an academic paper, full completion would be having read the paper and made notes, in full, the A grade of getting things done. Simple enough as a concept. The second is what I call “partial credit”, where I have made substantial effort towards a goal but fallen far short of finishing it. Consider this the C grade. To achieve partial credit, real demonstrable progress must have been made, rather than just a minimum amount of time spent on a topic. To continue with the example of reading an academic paper, partial credit might involve me making notes on the abstract, introduction and conclusion (the most relevant sections of any paper). While the full paper wasn’t read, I would gain enough information from these sections to consider my efforts somewhat worthwhile. 


The third measure I use is what I call the bare minimum approach. It’s used to avoid the dreaded “did not attempt” grade in exams, which in my eyes is worse than an F. The bare minimum approach is usually used in two cases: when the end goal is unspecified or to get me to do something that I would otherwise not even attempt because the task itself seems long and boring before I’m immersed in it. An example of the first case here would be reading a book. Measures of reading are usually based in pages or chapters or worse – the task is just “read”. However, books vary wildly in word count per page and chapter length. I prefer books that have short chapters and larger text, even if the number of pages in the book is much greater as a result. The main reason for this is that I like to feel like I’m making progress, but there are also smaller psychological tricks at play here. For example, if a book has very short chapters of only 5 pages or so, and I finish a chapter which lies on the left page of an open book, I’ll naturally read the right page as it’s right there. Then all of a sudden, there’s only four more pages to go until the next chapter, so I feel like I may as well go ahead and finish it. This cycle repeats, until the book is read in no time at all. 


The reason I do this is to avoid the paralysis that occurs when beginning a larger task. The hardest part of a task, in my experience, is getting started. There’s a mental block that occurs when I think about starting a task that involves considerable effort. So, I can tell myself that “okay, reading five chapters today sounds unrealistic. Let’s just do two, for partial credit”. Just like that, I’m beginning the task. Most of the time, at the end of that second chapter, I keep reading. Sometimes, even these partial credits seem to present a mental block. When this happens, I adopt the bare minimum approach. When reading a book, this would be to read one page. In practice I almost never only read a single page, but occasionally I will, just to not break the habit of reading daily. As this habit develops and the ‘streak’ of reading continues, it becomes progressively harder to break.
You can apply these approaches to any task, and I have included some examples below. I hope you find these helpful.
