title: ANT Theoretical Framework
---
Perhaps more so than any other theory of science, Actor-Network Theory (ANT) offers a way of understanding the use of artificial intelligence tools that accounts for their dualistic nature as both humanlike and machine, without pigeonholing their use into traditional assessments of human relations or adopting a purely materialistic approach. In turn, artificial intelligence systems may themselves provide the best support for ANT’s assertion that non-human actors have agency, given that such systems are often capable of reaching decisions and exercising judgement independently of human operation.
For purposes of analysis, this paper adopts the definition of agency as being the ability to act independently in bringing about change within a structure (Bourne, 2014). The structure in this case is border infrastructure on the Irish border, which may in the future consist of physical constructions such as fences or exist in a political sense only, as it does currently. These definitions contrast with those that would prescribe intentionality as a prerequisite for agency but dovetail nicely with the definition adopted by Latour (2005) who removes both intentionality and consciousness from this list of requirements.  
ANT can be understood as having a basis in systems thinking, in that it studies how actors which had not previously been considered as such can play a role in a wider network. These non-human actants are considered as valid as humans where discussions of agency are concerned. In the understanding of Latour (1990), non-human actants are not limited to machines or animals but also include abstract concepts, such as names. Latour built his approach to ANT around his experiences studying the philosophy of science, in particular with his study of the development of technologies and the realisation of science in a laboratory setting. Given the nature of the subject of this research project, such a theoretical framework appears particularly appropriate.
In ANT, networks may themselves be comprised of other networks, with these sub-networks having their own sub-networks, and this distinction carries down as far as the observer wishes, to the molecular level if necessary. As such, ANT can be thought of as an interdisciplinary and all-encompassing philosophy of science and nature. It is situated within the wider field of sociology but is interdisciplinary in that it crosses over into philosophical understandings of networks, nature and what it means to have agency. Indeed, Callon (1999) refers to ANT’s interdisciplinary nature as its main shortcoming; it is “everything but a theory” (p.182).
The proposed AI systems examined in this research project are not intended to be a total replacement for human border guards nor are they simply another tool in the arsenal of those guards, as a flashlight or gun might be. Rather, they are actors in their own right, capable of exercising judgement, communicating decisions and operating independently (that is, without the need for an active human operator). The aforementioned flashlight or gun form a part of a singular agent when combined with the border guard, with agency becoming distributed across several actants rather than remaining solely with the guard (Latour, 2005). Provided the tool used to shoot an illegal border-crosser, the gun-toting guard possesses an agency that an unarmed colleague would not, and as such is better understood as a security assemblage rather than a border guard (Latour, 1994). The guard is transformed by the possession of the gun, so that the two become a guard-gun hybrid, capable of actions that neither could have achieved independently. Such a translation (to borrow a term from Latour) may also occur in the use of AI systems for security purposes. If a border guard receives information from an AI system, they may feel empowered to take a decision that they otherwise would have rejected or have their decision-making process in some way altered.
