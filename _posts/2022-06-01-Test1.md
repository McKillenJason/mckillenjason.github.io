title: Mé Féin: The emergence and potential of lone-wolf violent dissident republicanism
---
The reduction of the Northern Ireland-related Terrorism Threat Level from “Severe” to “Substantial” in March 2022 was in large part the culmination of successful interventions by the state security forces. Most recently, the Security Service-directed Operation Arbacia significantly disrupted the leadership of what had been Northern Ireland’s largest and most active violent dissident republican (VDR) grouping, the New Irish Republican Army. However, the techniques used by the security forces to counter the security threat posed by VDRs appear to have thus far relied on group infiltration, in contrast to the noted focus on individual and micro-group actors present in Britain. This approach has created a counterterrorism blind spot, which in the past has allowed for successful attacks to be carried out by lone-wolf actors. While their impact has remained relatively muted thus far, lone-wolf actors have been responsible for as many security force deaths in the past twenty years as some established VDR groups. Several recent cases also illustrate the potential for lone-wolf violence to escalate, drawing in larger organisations. This presentation explores the emergence of these micro-actors, the current state of research into the phenomenon and potential academic and security responses.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63151553/171599702-a41985ab-8e4b-4be4-982e-6014620e23cc.png)
