title: When you work, work hard. When you're done, be done.

Today’s paper: Ericsson, K. A., Krampe, R. T., & Tesch-Römer, C. (1993). The role of deliberate practice in the acquisition of expert performance. Psychological Review, 100(3), 363–406. https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-295X.100.3.363

Dipping in and out of work is the norm for most people and is rewarded by current workplaces. The idea of being at your desk for eight hours, visible to your supervisor, is preferable to invisibly working hard and getting your workload for the day completed in two hours. This need to be seen to be working rather than actually working has become especially acute with the rise of remote working and accompanying business worries that employees are ‘slacking off’. When I worked in finance, I would have to complete five files a day on potential clients. At the same time, I was completing a full-time master’s degree in software development. Initially, I would complete the five files within the first few hours and then read a book, go for a walk and recharge myself in preparation for evening study, following Cal Newport’s philosophy of Deep Work. 

One day, my line manager asked me why I was appearing as “away from desk” for most of the afternoon on the internal communications platform. I explained that I had my work completed for the day and had then done additional cases before taking the afternoon off, as I usually did. Not long afterwards, I was called into a meeting and formally reprimanded for not spending as much time as possible at my desk. 

In response to my reprimand, my workload declined. I would spend the whole day doing my five cases, unable to help others, participate in social events throughout the day or tackle additional problems. I would start at 8:30AM and finish at 5:30PM, exhausted and unhappy from trying to fill nine hours with mindless drone work. I left not long afterwards, with my file quality having declined. I wasn’t working hard when I worked, because my employer didn’t respect me being done when I was done.

The central issue here is that people forget to factor intensity into approaches to working. I do a two-hour sprint; others jog for eight. It’s a mistake to assume that the ability to reach a certain intensity means that it can be sustained all day. We don’t expect Usain Bolt to run a 10K as fast as he runs 100m.

Was the problem here my manager, or me? In my view, we were both to blame. My manager was focused on the wrong metric, looking for time spent at my desk as a measure of my productivity rather than my actual productivity. I should have made a stronger case to management for my approach to working. I had the data to support my claim, my line manager knew my work was being done and being done well. Indeed, this is what I did my subsequent job as an engineer, where my new line manager saw the success of my results and passed it up the chain, eventually having it factored into the company’s policy on time management.

If you’re a deep worker like me, how can you achieve a situation where when you work until you’re done? 
1.	Before advocating for any changes, demonstrate that you can meet high standards using your preferred working style
2.	Communicate to your line managers privately that your style of working is vital to you achieving goals, using your demonstrated high standard of work as evidence
3.	If your company doesn’t respect your time, look elsewhere. If this isn’t possible, find new ways to get around their systems of monitoring. Many of my co-workers appeared to be at their online desks when in reality they were watching TV and simply moving their mouse cursors every few minutes. Others employed housemates to type gibberish into a Word document every now and then, while they were out shopping. In my view, if you’re meeting your work obligations faster than required, what you do with any extra time should be yours to decide.

Finally, if you’re using your non-working time to improve yourself through other means, make that clear. My next job heard that I was using this added time for my studies and worked with me to structure my workload in a way that reduced my stress levels come exam time. Sometimes, they appreciate sprinters.
